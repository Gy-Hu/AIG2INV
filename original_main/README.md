# AIG2INV
Leverage machine learning method on invariant synthesis

HZ note: I didn't push the dataset to github, but you should be able to find it on `/data/hongcezh/clause-learning/data-collect/data2dataset/test.pkl`
on the server. This is readable by users from the same group. This is just a test dataset. The collection of HWMCC dataset is still running.

To run the training process: `python3 train_t1.py`. The configurations are all hardcoded in `config.py`
